<p>First of all, welcome to my blog.</p>

<p>My name is Philippe Ozil, I have been a Consultant for Bonitasoft since 2010 and I have been involved in 80+ customer projects.
Starting from 2014, I have moved to the position of Technical Evangelist.</p>

<p>I am opening this blog to share my experience about working with Bonita BPM, extending it and integrating it with third party technologies.</p>

<p>Enjoy your reading and I hope you will find this content useful.</p>
