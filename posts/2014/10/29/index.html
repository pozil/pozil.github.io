<h3>The concept</h3>

<p>This week, we are at EclipseCon and after spending some time around our booth, we discussed with our neighbours
<a rel="noopener" href="https://www.bitreactive.com/" target="_blank" class="external">Bitreactive</a> about the possibility to create a joint technical demo.</p>

<p>I ended exploring the world of IoT and connected objects in order to put in place this technical demo.
I wanted to couple Bonita with the connected object from Bitreactive booth: a photo booth composed of a Raspberry Pi and a camera.</p>

</div>

<p>In order to implement this demo I used the <a rel="noopener" href="https://mqtt.org/" target="_blank" class="external">MQTT</a> protocol provided through the <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.eclipse.org/paho/" target="_blank" class="external">paho</a> Java library to communicate with the device.</p>

<p class="small-bottom-margin">The goal of the demo was to integrate the photo booth device into a Bonita process representing a visa application.
Here is how this process works:</p>
<ol>
	<li>the applicant provides his personal details and attaches his picture taken at the photo booth</li>
	<li>the visa official review the application details and decides to grant or refuse the application</li>
</ol>


<h3>MQTT proof of concept via a Bonita connector</h3>

<p>Before I actually started to work on the visa application process I made sure that I could easily connect with MQTT via paho from a simple Java application and from a Bonita connector.</p>

<p class="small-bottom-margin">I ended up implementing a generic Bonita MQTT connector that could publish messages to a remote broker.
I have shared this connector with the community here:</p>

</ul>


<h3>Implementing the MQTT subscriber</h3>

<p>Once I was familiar with the MQTT paho client I stared to work on the &lsquo;image receiver&rsquo; program.</p>

<p class="small-bottom-margin">This Java program does the following:</p>

<ol>
	<li>subscribe to the photo booth MQTT topic</li>
	<li>get a message for each picture taken</li>
	<li>extract the image from it and place them in a directory in the Bonita server</li>
</ol>

<p>All of these operations can be summarized with the following Java code extract:</p>

<div class="code-caption">MQTT subscribe code sample</div>
<pre>// Configure MQTT client
MqttClient client = new MqttClient(BROKER_URL, CLIENT_ID, new MemoryPersistence());
MqttConnectOptions options = new MqttConnectOptions();
options.setCleanSession(true);

// Connect client to broker
client.connect(options);

// Register a custom callback to process incoming messages
client.setCallback(new IncomingMessageCallback());
// Subscribe to image topic
client.subscribe(TOPIC);

// Later disconnect client
client.disconnect();</pre>


<h3>Implementing the Bonita process</h3>

<p>Once the incoming images were stored within the Bonita server, I implemented a Bonita process with forms showing up the images.</p>
