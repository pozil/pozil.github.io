<h3>About the talk</h3>

<p>In this talk, I presented NoSQL databases in general and MongoDB more in depth.
I then gave an overview of the pro and cons of using NoSQL databases vs traditional RDBMS 
illustrated with some good and bad uses cases.
I concluded by providing an example of an integration of MongoDB with Bonita BPM.</p>


<h3>Implementing the Bonita connectors for MongoDB</h3>

<p>For the need of the webinar I wanted to a least one MongoDB connector with the community.
A previous version of such a connector already existed but it lacked flexibility in its connection 
configuration and query definition.</p>

<p class="small-bottom-margin">In order to compensate for this, I implemented two connectors with:</p>
<ul>
	<li>A distinct connection mode: direct connection or pooled datasource</li>
	<li>Full text queries supporting server-side JS code</li>
</ul>

<p>This later point proved extremly useful when I built a sample &#8220;Mongo Store&#8221; set of processes to demonstrate the use of the connectors.<br/>
With this capability, I could write the following query in Groovy including a JS function that would be executed on the MongoDB server side:</p>

<div class="code-caption">Generating an id, inserting a document and returning its id</div>
<pre>StringBuffer query = new StringBuffer("function () {\n");
query.append("var id = ObjectId();\n");
query.append("db.productTypes.insert({_id : id, name : \""+ productTypeName +"\"});\n");
query.append("return id;");
query.append("}");
return query.toString();</pre>


<h3>Implementing a JNDI datasource for MongoDB</h3>

<p>While implementing these connectors, I discovered - with utmost disarray - that MongoDB did not provide a 
JNDI datasource implementation. It relies instead on a built-in pooling mechanism provided by the MongoDB client.</p>

<p>Being used to configure large Java applications, I must say that connection pooling and JNDI datasources 
are quite mandatory for performance as well as maintainability.<br/>
In consequence, I implemented a generic implementation of a JNDI datasource for MongoDB.</p>
