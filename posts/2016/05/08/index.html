<p>After a <s>brief</s> period of inactivity, it is now time for me to get back at writing this blog.</p>

<p>A couple of things have changes for me since my last post starting from my job: I am now Developer Evangelist at Salesforce.<br/>
That implies that you will probably read more Salesforce-related stuff here but not only. I will continue to blog about various technologies and Open Source projects.</p>

<p>With the opportunity of this new start, I dumped the previous blog tool I used (Octopress) and I took some time to create my own site from scratch.<br/>
Yes, I did re-invent the wheel on that occasion (do not try this at home) but...</p>
<ul>
	<li>it was fun :)</li>
	<li>I can now easily blog from any OS including Windows</li>
	<li>the whole blog project is now lighter and I have total flexibility to customize it</li>
</ul>

<p>Anyway, I hope you will continue to enjoy what I write here.</p>
