<p>It has now been a month since I joined Salesforce. A lot of exiting things happened during that time so I will try to summarize all of that in this post.</p>


<h3>A new company, a new culture</h3>
<p>When I decided to join Salesforce, I knew that I was going for some level of changes. Well, guess what... I was in for some surprises in the first couple of weeks: even more changes that I had anticipated!</p>

<p>Coming from a small startup with 100-130 employees, I was wondering how dynamic a 20K+ employees company would be. It turned out that I got the same level of reactivity than I was used to in my previous experience: things move lightning fast (pun intended).</p>

<p>I will not go over all of the company core values as it would take more than a single post but I will just highlight the most important one: Trust.<br/>
Trust is base of what we do. Whether it is for customers, community members or employees, trust is paramount for Salesforce operations.</p>

<p>One last important change I had to deal with was is my new work environment.
I got to learn about the myriad of internal tools we use and in particular, I got love the word 'Concierge' (our internal knowledge database).<br/>
Overall, I believe that good side of having all of these tools is that we can really be a zero-paper office.</p>


<h3>Getting involved in a blitz of events</h3>

<p>During my first month I have been traveling across Europe for various events (London, Madrid, Amsterdam, San Francisco...). It was a busy schedule but a fantastic experience.</p>
<p>I have learned a lot about the platform of course but most importantly: about our users and the community. Be it from customers or partners that are either developers, admins or end-users, I was amazed with overall level of engagement and the positive feedback we got.</p>

<p>The last event was probably the most significant, not in volume but in importance.
I got to attend Salesforce's first developer conference: <a href="https://developer.salesforce.com/trailheadx" target="_blank" class="external">TrailheaDX</a>.<br/>
I will probably write another post dedicated to that in the near future.</p>


<h3>Attending Bootcamp</h3>

<p>At time of writing I have only completed the first day of a week-long bootcamp.</p>

<p>This first day is particular as it deals with general orientation. We had some corporate presentations by executives such as Parker Harris.
We got an overview of the Aloha culture of the company and its vision. We also had a couple of exercises to help us present the company and the platform.</p>
<p>What I found the most interesting was a particular exercise focused on trust and security. The idea behind this is that each employee gets to act as the CSO (Chief Security Officer).</p>

<p>We ended the day with some special activity. As part of Salesforce <a href="http://www.salesforce.com/company/salesforceorg" target="_blank" class="external">philanthropic 1-1-1 model</a>, we got to do some volunteering time at the <a href="http://www.sfmfoodbank.org/" target="_blank" class="external">San Francisco food bank</a>.
Although this was just a couple of hours it proved to be great team effort that brought value to the bootcamp attendees and the community.</p>

<p>I am looking forward getting more information as we continue with Technology &amp; Product training.</p>
