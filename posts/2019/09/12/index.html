	<h1>An Overview of Lightning Web Components on the SalesforceWay Podcast</h1>
</header>

<p>I had the honor of being invited on the SalesforceWay Podcast by its host Xi Xiao.
We had a great chat during which I presented an overview of <a rel="noopener" href="https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/component-library/documentation/lwc" target="_blank">Lightning Web Components</a>.</p>

<p>Check out the <a rel="noopener" href="https://salesforceway.com/podcast/lightning-web-component/" target="_blank">podcast episode</a> to get the big picture of why Lightning Web Components are a game changer for all developers (not just Salesforce developers).</p>

<p>You'll hear how we're using of the latest and greatest web standards (web components, custom elements, shadow DOM, decorators just to name a few) to let you build blazing fast apps.
	You'll get an understanding of what's the <a rel="noopener" href="https://lwc.dev" target="_blank">Lightning Web Component Open Source</a> framework and how it's integrated with the Salesforce Platform.
</p>

<p>Last but not least, you'll walk away with some great learning resources such as a <a rel="noopener" href="http://sforce.co/lwc" target="_blank">curated list of Trailhead badges</a> and a collection of open source <a rel="noopener" href="https://trailhead.salesforce.com/sample-gallery" target="_blank">sample applications</a> that you can explore.</p>
